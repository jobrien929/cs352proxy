Architecture Description (Function Name: Description):
	allocate tunnel: function given to us for assignment, 
	outgoing: Reads from the TAP and send the proper data through the SOCKET (this repeats forever unless there is an error)
		  !!!!!!!!If there is an error it closes the tap and socket
		  Exits upon error of reading from the tap or writing to the socket after it prints the error
		  Prints how much data(in bytes) was read from the tap and how much data was sent through the socket
		  Ecapsulates the data with a header (type: 0xABCD length:__length of data(bytes)__) before sending it out
	incoming: Recieves data from the SOCKET and writes it to the TAP (this repeats forever unless there is an error)
		  !!!!!!!!If there is an error it closes the tap and socket
		  Exits upon error of receiving data from the socket or writing to the tap after it prints the error
		  Prints how much data(in bytes) was received from the socket and how much data was written to the tap
		  De-ecapsulates the header(type: 0xABCD length:__length of data(bytes)__) from the data before writing
		  	to the tap
	main:
	  1) Using the arguments provided by argv it determins whether it is a server or a client
	  
	  Client (Exits on error if any of these steps fail):
		2) Gets the IP Address of the server (converts the DNS host name to IPV4 dot decimal format if necessary)
		3) Creates file descriptor for socket
		4) Attempts to connect to server
		
	  Server (Exits on error if any of these steps fail)
		2) Binds the socket
		3) Listens for a request to connect from client
		4) Accepts connection from client
	  
	  main continued:
		5) Opens the tap interface
		6) Starts the thread for outgoing function
		7) Starts the thread for incoming function
		8) Waits for incoming and outgoing function returns which should never happen since they run forever

Difficulties (Problem:Solution):
	Understanding how to properly use the tap and properly setting it up : Just by playing with the tap
	Finding time to meet with group mem
